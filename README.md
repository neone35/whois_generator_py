# Whois generator

## Overview

## How to run it
1. Make sure you have Python 3+ installed with `python -V`
2. Create `.env` file with your domainr RapidAPI key (get [here](https://rapidapi.com/developer/))
3. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed at `requirements.txt`
4. Run main file with `python domain_generator.py`
5. Select between generator or scanner options
